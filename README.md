# Todo app
### CLI version

Simple app to manage a todo-list. Items in the list have
- an id,
- description of the task,
- status (backlog, working on, done),
- added timestamp,
- started work timestamp,
- finished timestamp.

A todo-list is saved to and read from a .json file. Your todo-lists are called projects. You have a single .json file for each project and of course can have multiple projects.
